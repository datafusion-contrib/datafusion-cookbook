# datafusion-cookbook

Cookbook with recipes for datafusion:

* [Query a file on S3](./content/docs/s3)
* [Query a file on S3 with a custom endpoint (eg: minio)](./content/docs/s3-custom-endpoint)
* [Acquire credentials with the AWS-RUST-SDK and query a file on S3](./content/docs/s3-sdk-credentials)
* [Query all files matching a globbing pattern on S3](./content/docs/s3-globbing)

Once we've written the instructions that go with the recipe (rust source code) the [datafusion-cookbook](https://datafusion-contrib.github.io/datafusion-cookbook/) site will probably be the appropriate entrypoint
